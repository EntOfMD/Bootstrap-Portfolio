  All right, whoever is looking at the source, I'll leave comments to explain wtf is going on. 

  philosophy: 
  Commenting/Documentation is like sex.
  When it's good, it's very good.
  when it's bad, it's better than nothing ...


  I personally felt like the instructor did a poor job of explaining the concept (BUT! you looking at my source shows you are willing to learn and are interested of HOW and WHY it works. I leave around easter eggs everywhere muaahahahahaha find them all ;), but If you haven't gotten by now the parent-children concept, think of it as russian nesting dolls.. 
  ex:
  <parent>
    <child 0>
      content
      <child 1>  <-|
        content    |---the parent is "child 0"
      </child 1> <-|
    </child 0>
  </parent>
    
  Now apply that for grid with 3 columns:
  <container> <---parent. Without it, row wouldn't look badass because it's programmed that way. 

    <row>  <----- child. You can have AS MANY rows as you want. Go nuts w/ it

      <column> <--sub-child 0
        content
      </column>

      <column> <--sub-child 1
        content
      </column>

      <column> <--sub-child 2
        content
      </column>

    </row>

  </container>
          **IF STILL NOT SURE ABOUT PARENT-CHILD, add class of "border", and you'll see the borders around**

    DON'T BE AFRAID TO EXPERIMENT. PROGRAMMING IS NOT SOME MYTHICAL THING, PEOPLE WROTE IT. THERE ARE MANUALS/DOCUMENTATION/YOUTUBE VIDEOS IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS EXPLAINING HOW TO/WHY/WHEN TO. 

    IT WON'T BITE YOUR FINGERS OR BREAK YOUR COMPUTER. ONE ADVISE I CAN GIVE IS DONT BE AFRAID TO FAIL. FAIL HARD, SO YOU CAN LEARN FROM IT AND MAKE THE NEXT ATTEMPT BETTER. YOU'LL HAVE A DAY WHEN YOU CLIMB OVER THE WALL OF "ITS HARD" AND YOU'LL BE LIKE "WOAH DUUDE"
